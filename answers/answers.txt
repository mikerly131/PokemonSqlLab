# Part 2:
# What are all the types of pokemon that a pokemon can have?
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM types;
    There are 18 types a pokemon can have.
    SELECT COLUMNS FROM pokemon;
    A pokemon can have a primary and a secondary type.
    Pairs = n(n-1)/2 or (18)(18-1)/2 = 153
    So 153 types can be created considering primary and secondary.
What is the name of the pokemon with id 45?

    A pokemon can have a primary and a secondary type.

I see these need to go in SQL files too, moving the rest of the stuff to there and this as well.
